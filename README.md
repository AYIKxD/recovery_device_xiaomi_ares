## Compile

First, set up the build environment following instructions from [PBRP's README](https://github.com/PitchBlackRecoveryProject/manifest_pb).

Then, to compile:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PitchBlackRecoveryProject/manifest_pb.git -b android-14.0 pb

# Enter the directory
cd pb

# Clone the device tree
git clone https://github.com/your-username/android_device_xiaomi_ares.git -b android-14.0 device/xiaomi/ares

# Clone the kernel
git clone https://github.com/your-username/android_kernel_xiaomi_ares.git -b android-14.0 kernel/xiaomi/ares

# Initialize the build environment
source build/envsetup.sh

# Lunch the device
lunch pb_ares-eng

# Build the recovery
mka pbrp
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any build errors:

1. Make sure you have Python installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

2. If you get "No such file or directory" errors for recovery/root:
```bash
mkdir -p device/xiaomi/ares/recovery/root
```

3. If you get path-related errors, make sure your device tree is in the correct location:
```bash
# Should be in:
device/xiaomi/ares/
```

4. If you get "Don't have a product spec for: 'pb_ares'", make sure:
- Your device tree is in the correct location
- You've run `source build/envsetup.sh`
- You're using the correct lunch command: `lunch pb_ares-eng`
